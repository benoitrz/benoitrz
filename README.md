Hiya! 👋 

I'm a senior software engineer based in Glasgow, Scotland.

I'm currently working at Smartsheet on Data Shuttle, helping customers seamlessly move data into and out of the Smartsheet platform.

Previously I used to work at SAS, building investigation software used by law enforcement.

And before that I worked at Adimo, a MarTech startup which went on winning the 2019 SaaS Startup of the Year Scottish Tech Award.
